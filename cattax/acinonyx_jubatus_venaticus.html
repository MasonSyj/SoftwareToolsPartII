      The <strong>Asiatic cheetah</strong>(<em>Acinonyx jubatus venaticus</em>)
      is a critically endangered cheetah subspecies currently only surviving in
      Iran (the Asiatic cheetah became extinct in India in 1948; the cheetahs
      which were reintroduced in 2022 are an African subspecies, the Southeast
      African cheetah). It once occurred from the Arabian Peninsula and the Near
      East to the Caspian region, Transcaucasus, Kyzylkum Desert and northern
      South Asia, but was extirpated in these regions during the 20th century.
      The Asiatic cheetah diverged from the cheetah population in Africa between
      32,000 and 67,000 years ago. The Asiatic cheetah survives in protected
      areas in the eastern-central arid region of Iran, where the human
         population density is very low. As of January 2022, the Iranian
         Department of Environment estimates that only 12 Asiatic cheetahs, 9
         males, and 3 females, are left in Iran.
