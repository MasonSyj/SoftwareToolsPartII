      <em>Panthera leo leo</em> is a lion subspecies, which is present in West
      Africa, northern Central Africa and India. In West and Central Africa it
      is restricted to fragmented and isolated populations with a declining
      trajectory. It has been referred to as the <strong>Northern lion</strong>.
      Results of a phylogeographic study indicate that lion populations in West
      and Central African range countries are genetically close to populations
      in India, forming a major clade distinct from lion populations in Southern
      and East Africa. <em>P. l. leo</em> is regionally extinct in North Africa,
      southern Europe, and West Asia. Asia's sole lion population lives in and
      around Gir National Park, India. The West African lion population is
      geographically isolated and numbers fewer than 250 mature individuals. It
         is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.
