      The <strong>margay</strong> (<em>Leopardus wiedii</em>) is a small wild
      cat native to Central and South America. A solitary and nocturnal cat, it
      lives mainly in primary evergreen and deciduous forest. Until the 1990s,
      margays were hunted illegally for the wildlife trade, which resulted in a
      large population decrease. Since 2008, the margay has been listed as Near
      Threatened on the IUCN Red List because the population is thought to be
      declining due to loss of habitat following deforestation. The original scientific
      name <em>Felis wiedii</em> was used by Heinrich Rudolf Schinz in 1821 in

      subspecies are currently considered valid taxa:
