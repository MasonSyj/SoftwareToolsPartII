      The <strong>Arabian leopard</strong> (<em>Panthera pardus nimr</em>) is a
      leopard subspecies native to the Arabian Peninsula. It has been listed as
      Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1996 as fewer than 200
      wild individuals were estimated to be alive in 2006. The population is
      severely fragmented. Subpopulations are isolated and not larger than 50
       mature individuals. The population is thought to decline continuously.
       The Arabian leopard is the smallest leopard subspecies. It was
       tentatively affirmed as a distinct subspecies by genetic analysis of a
       single wild leopard from South Arabia, which appeared most closely
       related to the African leopard.
