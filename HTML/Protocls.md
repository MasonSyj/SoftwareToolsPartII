HTTP:
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is an application protocol that is used to transmit data on the World Wide Web (WWW). HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. For example, when you type a URL in your web browser, the browser uses HTTP to send a request to the server hosting the website, and the server responds with the requested data in the form of an HTTP response.


HTTPS:
HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a secure version of HTTP, which means all communication between the client (such as a web browser) and the server is encrypted. HTTPS is used to protect sensitive data, such as login credentials, credit card information, and personal information. For example, when you log into your online banking account, you will notice that the website URL starts with "https://". This means that the data you enter is encrypted and secure from potential eavesdroppers.


TLS:
TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. It is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over the internet. TLS is used to encrypt data between the client and the server. HTTPS uses TLS to encrypt the data being transmitted between the client and the server.


TCP:
TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable communication between two network devices. TCP is responsible for breaking the data into packets, numbering them, and reassembling them at the destination. TCP is used for applications that require high reliability, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.


IP:
IP stands for Internet Protocol. It is a protocol that is used for routing data packets between different network devices. IP is responsible for addressing and routing packets of data between devices. For example, when you send an email, the email is broken up into packets and then sent through the internet to the recipient's email server. IP is responsible for routing those packets to the correct server.


Route:
A route is a path that is used to send data between two network devices. A route is determined by the network's routing table, which is a list of routes that tells the device where to send data. For example, when you send an email to someone in another country, the data is sent through a series of routers, each of which uses its routing table to determine where to send the data next. The route may change depending on network conditions, such as congestion or failures.


In summary, HTTP is the protocol used to transmit data on the web, HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, TLS is used to encrypt data in HTTPS, TCP provides reliable communication between devices, IP is responsible for routing data between devices, and routes are determined by a device's routing table. These protocols and concepts all work together to ensure that data is transmitted securely and reliably over the internet.
