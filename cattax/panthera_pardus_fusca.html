      The <strong>Indian leopard</strong> (<em>Panthera pardus fusca</em>) is a
      leopard subspecies widely distributed on the Indian subcontinent. The
      species <em>Panthera pardus</em> is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red
      List because populations have declined following habitat loss and
      fragmentation, poaching for the illegal trade of skins and body parts, and
      persecution due to conflict situations. The Indian leopard is one of the
      big cats occurring on the Indian subcontinent, along with the Asiatic
      lion, Bengal tiger, snow leopard and clouded leopard. In 2014, a
      national census of leopards around tiger habitats was carried out in
      India except the northeast. 7,910 individuals were estimated in
      surveyed areas and a national total of 12,000â€“14,000 speculated.
