      The <strong>Pallas's cat</strong> (<em>Otocolobus manul</em>), also known
      as the <strong>manul</strong>, is a small wild cat with long and dense
      light grey fur, and rounded ears set low on the sides of the head. Its
      head-and-body length ranges from 46 to 65 cm (18 to 26 in) with a 21 to
      31 cm (8.3 to 12.2 in) long bushy tail. It is well camouflaged and adapted
      to the cold continental climate in its native range, which receives little
      rainfall and experiences a wide range of temperatures. Due to its
      widespread range and assumed large population, the Pallas's cat has been
      listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2020. Some population
      units are threatened by poaching, prey base decline due to rodent control
      programs, and habitat fragmentation as a result of mining and
         infrastructure projects. Since 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force
         of the Cat Specialist Group recognises only two subspecies as valid
         taxa.
