1.  RFC:

The term RFC stands for "Request for Comments." It's a type of document that describes a proposed standard or specification for the internet. RFCs are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and are intended to promote consensus and open discussion among experts in the field.

2.  Socket:

A socket is a software endpoint that facilitates communication between two processes over a network. In the context of web development, sockets are used to establish connections between clients and servers, allowing them to exchange data and requests.

3.  Port:

A port is a communication endpoint in an operating system that allows processes to communicate with each other. A port is identified by a number ranging from 0 to 65535. Some ports are reserved for specific purposes, such as port 80 for HTTP traffic, while others can be used for any purpose.

4.  Port 80:

Port 80 is the default port used for HTTP traffic. When a client makes a request to a web server using the HTTP protocol, the request is sent over port 80 by default, unless a different port is specified in the URL.

5.  HTTP/1.1:

HTTP stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol," and it's the protocol used by web browsers and servers to exchange data and requests. HTTP/1.1 is a version of the protocol that introduced several improvements over the earlier HTTP/1.0 version, including the ability to reuse connections, support for chunked encoding, and better support for caching.
