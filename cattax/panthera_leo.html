      The <strong>lion</strong> (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is a large cat of the
      genus <em>Panthera</em> native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
      broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at
      the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger
      than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming
      groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males,
      related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together,
      preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone
      predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have
      been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and
      prey on humans. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat
      Specialist Group revised lion taxonomy, and recognises two subspecies
      based on results of several phylogeographic studies on lion evolution.
