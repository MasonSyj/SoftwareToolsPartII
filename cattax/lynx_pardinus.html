      The <strong>Iberian lynx</strong> (<em>Lynx pardinus</em>) is a wild cat
      species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe. It is
      listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. In the 20th century, the
      Iberian lynx population had declined because of overhunting, poaching,
      fragmentation of suitable habitats, and the population decline of its main
      prey species, the European rabbit (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>), caused
      by myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease. By the turn of the 21st
      century, the Iberian lynx was on the verge of extinction, as only 94
      individuals survived in two isolated subpopulations in Andalusia in 2002.
      Conservation measures have been implemented since then, which included
         improving habitat, restocking of rabbits, translocating, reintroducing
         and monitoring Iberian lynxes. By 2012, the population had increased to
         326 individuals, to 855 in 2020, and to 1,111 in 2021.
