      The <strong>tiger</strong> (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) is the largest
      living cat species and a member of the genus <em>Panthera</em>. It is most
      recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white
      underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer
      and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social
      predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its
      requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with
      their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving
      their mother's home range to establish their own. The tiger was first
      scientifically described in 1758. It once ranged widely from the Eastern
      Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and 
    in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands.
    Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their
    historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the
    islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and
    China. What remains of the range where tigers still roam free is fragmented,
    stretching in spots from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical
    forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and a single Indonesian island,
    Sumatra.  The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of 2015,
    the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and
    3,948 mature individuals, with most populations living in small isolated
    pockets. India currently hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for
    population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and
    poaching. Tigers are also victims of humanâ€“wildlife conflict, due to
    encroachment in countries with a high human population density. In 2017, the
    Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid
    taxonomy in accordance with the two-subspecies proposal of the comprehensive
    2015 study, and recognized the tiger populations in continental Asia as <em>P.
      t. tigris</em>, and those in the Sunda Islands as <em>P. t. sondaica</em>.
