      The <strong>rusty-spotted cat</strong> (<em>Prionailurus rubiginosus</em>)
      is one of the cat family's smallest members, of which historical records
      are known only from India and Sri Lanka. In 2012, it was also recorded in
      the western Terai of Nepal. Since 2016, the global wild population is
      listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List as it is fragmented and
         affected by loss and destruction of its prime habitat, deciduous forests.
