React Strict Mode is a development mode that can be enabled in a React application to provide additional checks and warnings during development.

When enabled, React Strict Mode highlights potential problems in your code, such as:

Identifying unsafe lifecycle methods in your code.
Warning you if you use legacy string ref API.
Highlighting potential issues with passing down functions as props.
Detecting unexpected side effects during render.
Detecting deprecated findDOMNode() usage.

React Strict Mode does not affect the behavior of the application in production, and it is intended to be used during development only. By using Strict Mode, developers can catch potential issues early in the development process, improving code quality and reducing the likelihood of errors in production.

To enable Strict Mode in a React application, you can simply wrap your root component inside a <React.StrictMode> component.
