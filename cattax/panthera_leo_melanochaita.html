      <em>Panthera leo melanochaita</em> is a lion subspecies in Southern and East
      Africa. In this part of Africa, lion populations are regionally extinct
      in Lesotho, Djibouti and Eritrea, and are threatened by loss of habitat
      and prey base, killing by local people in retaliation for loss of
      livestock, and in several countries also by trophy hunting. Since the
      turn of the 21st century, lion populations in intensively managed
      protected areas in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe have
      increased, but declined in East African range countries. Within <em>P. l.
        melanochaita</em> three subclades are clearly distinguishable. One from
      northeastern Africa, another one from southwestern Africa and a third
      one from southeastern Africa. The type specimen for <em>P. l.
        melanochaita</em> was a black-maned lion from the Cape of Good Hope,
      known as the Cape lion.
      Phylogeographic analysis of lion samples from Gabon and the Republic of
      the Congo indicate their close genetic relation to <em>P. l.
        melanochaita</em> samples from Namibia and Botswana. 
      It has been referred to as the
      <strong>Southern lion</strong>, <strong>Southern African lion</strong>
      and the 'southern subspecies'.
