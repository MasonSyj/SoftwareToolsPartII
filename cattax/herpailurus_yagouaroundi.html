      The <strong>jaguarundi</strong> (<em>Herpailurus yagouaroundi</em>) is a
      wild cat native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina
      in the south to northern Mexico, through Central and South America east of
      the Andes. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build. Its
      coloration is uniform with two color morphs, gray and red. It has an
      elongated body, with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small,
      round ears, a short snout, and a long tail, resembling mustelids in these
      respects. It is about twice as large as a domestic cat (<em>Felis
        catus</em>), reaching nearly 360 mm (14 in) at the shoulder, and weighs
      3.5–7 kg (7.7–15.4 lb). Phylogeographical analysis of jaguarundi samples
      from across its range has found no genetic evidence for subspecies.
