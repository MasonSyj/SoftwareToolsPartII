      The <strong>Balkan lynx</strong> (<em>Lynx lynx balcanicus</em>) is a
      subspecies of the Eurasian lynx in the genus <em>Lynx</em>. It is found in
      Albania, Kosovo, eastern Serbia, and western North Macedonia, with smaller
      populations in Montenegro. It is considered a national symbol in North
      Macedonia and appears on the 5-denar coin.
It is believed that in North Macedonia there are from 35 to 40 remaining Balkan
lynx, mostly found in Mavrovo National Park. This cat is considered to be the
largest cat in the Balkans. It has been sighted in 2011 and 2012 in the northern
mountainous region of Albania and within the boundaries of the
         Shebenik-Jabllanice National Park. The lynx is classified as Critically
         Endangered in Albania and has been protected de jure since 1969 but,
         despite this, illegal poaching and habitat destruction threatens the
         remaining Balkan lynx populations in both Albania and North Macedonia.
         There are an estimated 15-20 individuals still alive in Albania. The
         Balkan lynx has been on the brink of extinction for nearly a century,
         with total numbers estimated to be fewer than 50.
