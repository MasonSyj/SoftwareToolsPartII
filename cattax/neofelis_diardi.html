      The <strong>Sunda clouded leopard</strong> (<em>Neofelis diardi</em>) is a
      medium-sized wild cat native to Borneo and Sumatra. It is listed as
      Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2015, as the total effective
      population probably consists of fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, with
      a decreasing population trend. On both Sunda islands, it is threatened by
      deforestation. It was classified as a separate species, distinct from the
      clouded leopard in mainland Southeast Asia based on a study in 2006. Its
      fur is darker with a smaller cloud pattern. This cat is also known as the
      <strong>Sundaland clouded leopard</strong>, <strong>Enkuli clouded
        leopard</strong>, <strong>Diard's clouded leopard</strong>, and
      <strong>Diard's cat</strong>. Molecular, craniomandibular, and dental
      analysis indicates the Sunda clouded leopard has two distinct subspecies
      with separate evolutionary histories:
