      The <strong>bobcat</strong> (<em>Lynx rufus</em>) also known as the
      <strong>red lynx</strong>, is a medium-sized cat native to North America. It ranges from
      southern Canada through most of the contiguous United States to Oaxaca in
      Mexico. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2002, due
      to its wide distribution and large population. Although it has been hunted
      extensively both for sport and fur, populations have proven stable, though
      declining in some areas. Two subspecies are recognised.
