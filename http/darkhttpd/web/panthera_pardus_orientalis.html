      The <strong>Amur leopard</strong> (<em>Panthera pardus orientalis</em>) is
      a leopard subspecies native to the Primorye region of southeastern Russia
      and northern China. It is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red
      List, as in 2007, only 19â€“26 wild leopards were estimated to survive in
      southeastern Russia and northeastern China. It is considered one of the
       rarest cats on Earth. In 2019, it was reported that the population was
       about 90 leopards. In 2021, it was reported the population was about
       110 individuals. Results of genetic research indicate that the Amur
       leopard is genetically close to leopards in northern China and Korea,
       suggesting that the leopard population in this region became fragmented
       in the early 20th century. The North Chinese leopard was formerly
       recognised as a distinct subspecies (<em>P. p. japonensis</em>), but was 
       subsumed under the Amur leopard in 2017.
