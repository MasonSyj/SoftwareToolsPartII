      The <strong>Caucasian wildcat</strong> (<em>Felis silvestris caucasica</em>) is a European wildcat subspecies that inhabits the Caucasus Mountains and Turkey. The Caucasian wildcat differs from the European wildcat by being lighter gray in colour, with a fainter pattern on the sides and the tail. It is similar in size, measuring 70–75 cm (28–30 in) in head to body length, 26–28 cm (10–11 in) in shoulder height. It weighs 5.2–6 kg (11–13 lb), rarely more than 8 kg (18 lb). In Turkey, the wildcat is considered common in mesic and mixed oak-beech forests of the Pontic Mountains, but rare in the Marmara and Aegean Sea regions. In the Taurus Mountains, it probably only occurs in deciduous forest of Kahramanmaraş Province. It is possibly extinct in the Eastern Anatolia Region.
