      The <strong>flat-headed cat</strong> (<em>Prionailurus planiceps</em>) is
      a small wild cat native to the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and Sumatra.
      It is listed as an Endangered species, because the wild population probably
      comprises fewer than 2,500 mature individuals, with small subpopulations
      of no more than 250 adults. The population inhabits primarily wetlands,
      which are being destroyed and converted. For these reasons, it has been listed on the IUCN Red List since 2008.
