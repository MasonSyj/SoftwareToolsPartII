      The <strong>cat</strong> is a domestic species of small carnivorous
      mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family <em>Felidae</em>
      and is commonly referred to as the <strong>domestic cat</strong> or
      <strong>house cat</strong> to distinguish it from the wild members of the
      family. Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or
      feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic
      cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill
      rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries. In
      2007, it was considered a subspecies, <em>F. silvestris catus</em>, of the
      European wildcat (<em>F. silvestris</em>) following results of
      phylogenetic research. In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce
      followed the recommendation of the ICZN in regarding the domestic cat as a
      distinct species, <em>Felis catus</em>.
