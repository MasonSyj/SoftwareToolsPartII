      The <strong>snow leopard</strong> (<em>Panthera uncia</em>), also known as
      the <strong>ounce</strong>, is a felid in the genus <em>Panthera</em>
      native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. It is listed as
      Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the global population is estimated
      to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and is expected to decline
       about 10% by 2040. It is threatened by poaching and habitat destruction
       following infrastructural developments. It inhabits alpine and
       subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000–4,500 m (9,800–14,800 ft),
       ranging from eastern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau
       to southern Siberia, Mongolia and western China. In the northern part
       of its range, it also lives at lower elevations. Taxonomically, the
       snow leopard was long classified in the monotypic genus <em>Uncia</em>.
       Since phylogenetic studies revealed the relationships among Panthera
       species, it has been considered a member of that genus. Two subspecies
       were described based on morphological differences, but genetic
       differences between the two have not been confirmed. It is therefore
       regarded as a monotypic species.T
