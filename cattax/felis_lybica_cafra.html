      The <strong>Southern African wildcat</strong> is an African wildcat
      subspecies native to Southern and Eastern Africa. In 2007, it was
      tentatively recognised as a distinct subspecies on the basis of genetic
      analysis. Morphological evidence indicates that the split between the
         African wildcat subspecies in Africa occurred in the area of Tanzania
         and Mozambique. It is also known in English as the <strong>bush
           cat</strong>.
