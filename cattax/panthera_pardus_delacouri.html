      The <strong>Indochinese leopard</strong> (<em>Panthera pardus
        delacouri</em>) is a leopard subspecies native to mainland Southeast
      Asia and southern China. In Indochina, leopards are rare outside protected
      areas and threatened by habitat loss due to deforestation as well as
      poaching for the illegal wildlife trade. The population trend is suspected
      to be decreasing. As of 2016, the population is thought to comprise
         973–2,503 mature individuals, with only 409–1,051 breeding adults. The
         historical range has decreased by more than 90%
