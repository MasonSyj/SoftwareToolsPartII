      The <strong>African golden cat</strong> is a wild cat endemic to the
      rainforests of West and Central Africa. It is threatened due to
      deforestation and bushmeat hunting and listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN
      Red List. It is a close relative of both the caracal and the serval.
      Previously, it was placed in the genus <em>Profelis</em>. Phylogenetic
      analysis of cat samples showed that the African golden cat is closely
      related with the caracal (<em>Caracal caracal</em>). Because of this close
      relationship, the African golden cat has been placed into the genus
      <em>Caracal</em>.  Two African golden cat subspecies are recognised as valid since 2017:
