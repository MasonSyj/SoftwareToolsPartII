      <strong>Felidae</strong> is the family of mammals in the order
      <em>Carnivora</em> colloquially referred to as <em>cats</em>. A member of
      this family is also called a <strong>felid</strong>. The term "cat" refers
      both to felids in general and specifically to the domestic cat (<em>Felis
        catus</em>).
      The 41 Felidae species exhibit the most diverse fur pattern of all terrestrial carnivores. Cats have retractile claws, slender muscular bodies and strong flexible forelimbs. Their teeth and facial muscles allow for a powerful bite. They are all obligate carnivores, and most are solitary predators ambushing or stalking their prey. Wild cats occur in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Some wild cat species are adapted to forest habitats, some to arid environments, and a few also to wetlands and mountainous terrain. Their activity patterns range from nocturnal and crepuscular to diurnal, depending on their preferred prey species.
      Today, the living Felidae are divided in two subfamilies: the
      <em>Pantherinae</em> and <em>Felinae</em>. Pantherinae includes five
      <em>Panthera</em> and two <em>Neofelis</em> species, while
      <em>Felinae</em> includes the other 34 species in ten genera.
