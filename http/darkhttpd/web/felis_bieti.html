      The <strong>Chinese mountain cat</strong> (<em>Felis bieti</em>), also
      known as <strong>Chinese desert cat</strong> and <strong>Chinese steppe
        cat</strong>, is a small wild cat endemic to western China that has been
      listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2002, as the effective
      population size may be fewer than 10,000 mature breeding individuals. It
      was provisionally classified as a wildcat subspecies with the name <em>F.
        silvestris bieti</em> in 2007. It is recognised as a valid species since
      2017, as it is morphologically distinct from wildcats.
