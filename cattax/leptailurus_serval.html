      The <strong>serval</strong> (<em>Leptailurus serval</em>) is a wild cat
      native to Africa. It is widespread in sub-Saharan countries, except
      rainforest regions. Across its range, it occurs in protected areas, and
      hunting it is either prohibited or regulated in range countries. It is the
      sole member of the genus <em>Leptailurus</em>. Three subspecies are
      recognised. The serval is a slender, medium-sized cat that stands 54–62 cm
      (21–24 in) at the shoulder and weighs 9–18 kg (20–40 lb). It is
      characterised by a small head, large ears, a golden-yellow to buff coat
      spotted and striped with black, and a short, black-tipped tail. The serval
      has the longest legs of any cat relative to its body size.
