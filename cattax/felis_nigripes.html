      The <strong>black-footed cat</strong> (<em>Felis nigripes</em>), also
      called the <strong>small-spotted cat</strong>, is the smallest wild cat in
      Africa, having a head-and-body length of 35–52 cm (14–20 in). Despite its
      name, only the soles of its feet are black or dark brown. With its bold
      small spots and stripes on the tawny fur, it is well camouflaged,
      especially on moonlit nights. It bears black streaks running from the
      corners of the eyes along the cheeks, and its banded tail has a black tip.
