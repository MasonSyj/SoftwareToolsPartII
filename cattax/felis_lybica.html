      The <strong>African wildcat</strong> (<em>Felis lybica</em>) is a small
      wildcat species native to Africa, West and Central Asia up to Rajasthan in
      India and Xinjiang in China. It has been listed as Least Concern on the
      IUCN Red List in 2022. In Cyprus, an African wildcat was found in a burial
      site next to a human skeleton in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B settlement
      Shillourokambos. The graves are estimated to have been established by
      Neolithic farmers about 9,500 years ago, and are the earliest known
      evidence for a close association between a cat and a human. Their
      proximity indicates that the cat may have been tamed or domesticated.
      Results of genetic research indicate that the African wildcat genetically
      diverged into three clades about 173,000 years ago, namely the Near
      Eastern wildcat, Southern African wildcat and Asiatic wildcat. African
      wildcats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Near East,
      and are the ancestors of the domestic cat (<em>F. catus</em>). Domestic cats and African wildcats remain closely related in the present day; interspecific hybrids between domestic cat and African wildcats are common, and occur where their ranges overlap. Since 2017, three African wildcat subspecies are recognised as valid taxa:
