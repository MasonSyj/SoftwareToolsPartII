      The <strong>North American cougar</strong> (<em>Puma concolor couguar</em>) is a cougar subspecies in North America. It is the biggest cat in North America, with North American jaguars being fairly small. It was once common in eastern North America, and is still prevalent in the western half of the continent. This subspecies includes populations in western Canada, the western United States, Florida, Mexico and Central America, and possibly South America northwest of the Andes Mountains. It thus includes the extirpated Eastern cougar and extant Florida panther populations.
