Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the array.groupBy(fn) method on any array and it will return a grouped version of the array.

A grouped array is an object where each key is the output of fn(arr[i]) and each value is an array containing all items in the original array with that key.

The provided callback fn will accept an item in the array and return a string key.

The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the array. Any order of keys is acceptable.

Please solve it without lodash's _.groupBy function.


/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {Function} fn
 * @param {number} init
 * @return {number}
 */
var reduce = function(nums, fn, init) {
   for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
       nums[i] = fn(init, nums[i]);
       init = nums[i];
   }
   return init;
};
