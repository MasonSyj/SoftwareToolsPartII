      The <strong>clouded leopard</strong> (<em>Neofelis nebulosa</em>), also
      called the <strong>mainland clouded leopard</strong>, is a wild cat
      inhabiting dense forests from the foothills of the Himalayas through
      mainland Southeast Asia into South China. A clouded leopard was brought to
      London from China and described in 1821. It  has large dusky-grey blotches
      and irregular spots and stripes reminiscent of clouds. Its head-and-body
      length ranges from 68.6 to 108 cm (27.0 to 42.5 in) with a 61 to 91 cm (24
      to 36 in) long tail. It uses its tail for balancing when moving in trees
      and is able to climb down vertical tree trunks head first.  It rests in
      trees during the day and hunts by night on the forest floor.  The clouded
      leopard is the first cat that genetically diverged 9.32 to 4.47 million
      years ago from the common ancestor of the pantherine cats.  Today, the
      clouded leopard is locally extinct in Singapore, Taiwan, and possibly
      Hainan Island and Vietnam. Its total population is suspected to be fewer
      than 10,000 mature individuals, with a decreasing population trend, and no
      single population numbering more than 1,000 adults. It has therefore been
      listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 2008. The population is
      threatened by large–scale deforestation and commercial poaching for the
      wildlife trade. Its body parts are offered for decoration and clothing,
      though it is legally protected in most range countries.  At present,
      <em>N. nebulosa</em> is considered a monotypic species due to lack of
      evidence for subspeciation.
