      The <strong>cougar</strong> (<em>Puma concolor</em>) is a large cat native
      to the Americas. Its range spans from the Canadian Yukon to the southern
      Andes in South America and is the most widespread of any large wild
      terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. It is an adaptable,
      generalist species, occurring in most American habitat types. This wide
      range has brought it many common names, including <strong>puma</strong>,
      <strong>mountain lion</strong>, <strong>catamount</strong> and
      <strong>panther</strong> (for the Florida sub-population). It is the
      second-largest cat in the New World, after the jaguar (<em>Panthera
        onca</em>). Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is
      properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although daytime
      sightings do occur. Despite its size, the cougar is more closely related
      to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (<em>Felis catus</em>) than to any
      species of the subfamily <em>Pantherinae</em>. As of 2017, the Cat
      Classification Taskforce of the Cat Specialist Group recognizes only two
      subspecies as valid:
