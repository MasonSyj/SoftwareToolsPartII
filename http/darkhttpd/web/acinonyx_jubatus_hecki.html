      The <strong>Northwest African cheetah</strong> (<em>Acinonyx jubatus hecki</em>) also known as the Saharan cheetah, is a cheetah subspecies native to the Sahara and the Sahel. The Northwest African cheetah is quite different in appearance from the other African cheetahs. Its coat is shorter and nearly white in color, with spots that fade from black over the spine to light brown on the legs. The face has few or even no spots, and the tear stripes (dark stripes running from the medial canthus of each eye down the side of the muzzle to the corner of the mouth) are often missing. It is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. In 2008, the population was suspected to number less than 250 mature individuals.</p>
