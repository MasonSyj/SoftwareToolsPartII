      The <strong>leopard cat</strong> (<em>Prionailurus bengalensis</em>) is a
      small wild cat native to continental South, Southeast, and East Asia.
      Since 2002 it has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List as it
      is widely distributed although threatened by habitat loss and hunting in
      parts of its range. Historically, the leopard cat of continental Asia was
      considered the same species as the Sunda leopard cat. As of 2017, the
      latter is recognised as a distinct species, with the taxonomic name
      <em>Prionailurus javanensis</em>. Leopard cat subspecies differ widely in
      fur colour, tail length, skull shape and size of carnassials.
      Archaeological evidence indicates that the leopard cat was the first cat
      species domesticated in Neolithic China about 5,000 years ago in Shaanxi
      and Henan Provinces. Two mainland leopard cat subspecies are currently
      recognised.
